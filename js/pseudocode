// Pacman Game
// An 18x18 grid container which represents the board/game
// We have a pacman character who moves constantly in one direction
// The user can change pacmans direction with the arrow keys
// The aim is to pass through every cell with food in it without colliding with a ghost in the same cell
// The ghosts 'chase' pacman with varying personalities, aiming to collide
// Some cells contain a power up which changes the game state to "frightented"
// When the ghosts are frightened they run away from pacman and a secondary aim is now to purposefully collide
// If collision occurs in frightened mode, the ghosts return to the home area
// If all the food is collected successfully without colliding, player wins the round.
// There is a combination of inaccessible and accessible cells


// Elements

// Score
// Board



// Variables and Constants

// columns and rows
// Pacman starting and current position
// Starting and current position of each ghost
// Score
// Speeds of pacman and ghosts
// gameState
// State timers
// cells array
// invalid and valid cells array, home cells array, power-up array
// intervals


// Executions

// Main Game function
// - function: Should render the game board, place pacman and ghosts in starting positions by adding classes to cells and 
//      should place the food and power ups in cells
// - function: Interval for moving pacman in a direction constantly
//     - finds the next cell
//     - disallow moving to invalid cells
//     - helper function for changing the image so pacman is always looking the correct direction
// - function: Interval for moving ghosts 
// - Should remove food that has been eaten and add score
// - Should change game state when power-ups have been eaten
//    - function: This changes ghost behaviour and colour 

// renderGame / Set up function

// pacmanMovement(direction) function
// - moves pacman from cell to cell in one direction (events will change direction)
// - stops movement if confronted by an invalid cell
// - handles cell collision - ends game

// Ghost movements -> first understanding, more complex logic to be added and considered
// ---Shared logic---
// - ghosts move at the same speed and slower than pacman
// - Each have a target tile to reach, which will dynamically change based on pacman's current tile
// - Decisions to be calculated when turns are reached, otherwise they travel straight
// -  Ghosts dont turn around except for in frightened mode they always turn first
// - In frightened mode they run away from pacman and choose psuedorandomly which turns to take
// - Scatter mode they head towards predetermined tiles
// - handle collisions
//    - if two classes in one cell
//    - if ghosts, choose one? 
//    - if pacman and ghosts, end game or send ghost back to home


//  - SEARCH ALGO -> shortest path to target 

// - Blinky (red)
// - starts outside of home 
// - target cell is always pacman's current position
// - speed increases slightly at intervals -> at same interval, scatter behaviour changes and target tile is still pacman

// - Pinky 
// - target cell is 4 ahead of pacman
// - to consider: What happens when they are within 4 cells of eachother??
// - leaves home immediately when game starts

// - Inky (blue)
// - target calculate based on the current direction of pacman and the positioning of blinky
// - vector between blinky and 2 squares in front of pacman, doubled
// - leaves home after x amount of food eaten
// - I might simplify this

// - clyde (orange)
// - last to leave home (predetermined)
// - if > 8 tiles away from pacman, use blinky's moveement
// - else tends towards a specific square


// changeState
// - frightened:
// - changes ghost behaviour and colour
// - collision is beneficial for pacman now and ghosts return to home if eaten
// - Scatter: Ghosts reverse direction and travel towards 


//  STATES
// frighten()
// - ghosts reverse direction and take turns psuedorandomly

// scatter()
// -  ghosts take shortest path toward preterminded squares


// endGame
// - ends game when all food is eaten or pacman collides with ghost outside of frightened mode


// Events

// Keys pressed down
// changes pacman direction
